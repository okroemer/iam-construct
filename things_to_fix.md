# iam-vision
- missing colon after if statement on line 43
- which DEXTR file to use in `Prog/iam-interface/iam-bokeh-server` ? 
    - dextr.py or new_dextr.py
- error for iam-domain-handler and iam-bt: `ImportError: libpillar_state.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`
    - may just be due to me running this without a Franka (for now, will check tomorrow)
